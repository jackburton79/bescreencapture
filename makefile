## BeOS Generic Makefile v2.5 ##

## Fill in this file to specify the project being created, and the referenced
## makefile-engine will do all of the hard work for you.  This handles both
## Intel and PowerPC builds of the BeOS and Haiku.

## Application Specific Settings ---------------------------------------------

# specify the name of the binary
NAME=BeScreenCapture

# specify the type of binary
#	APP:	Application
#	SHARED:	Shared library or add-on
#	STATIC:	Static library archive
#	DRIVER: Kernel Driver
TYPE=APP

# 	if you plan to use localization features 
# 	specify the application MIME siganture
APP_MIME_SIG=application/x-vnd.BeScreenCapture

#	add support for new Pe and Eddie features
#	to fill in generic makefile

#%{
# @src->@ 

#	specify the source files to use
#	full paths or paths relative to the makefile can be included
# 	all files, regardless of directory, will have their object
#	files created in the common object directory.
#	Note that this means this makefile will not work correctly
#	if two source files with the same name (source.c or source.cpp)
#	are included from different directories.  Also note that spaces
#	in folder names do not work well with this makefile.

#	specify additional libraries to link against
#	there are two acceptable forms of library specifications
#	-	if your library follows the naming pattern of:
#		libXXX.so or libXXX.a you can simply specify XXX
#		library: libbe.so entry: be
#
#	-	for version-independent linking of standard C++ libraries please add
#		$(STDCPPLIBS) instead of raw "stdc++[.r4] [supc++]" library names
#
#	-	for localization support add following libs:
#		locale localestub
#		
#	- 	if your library does not follow the standard library
#		naming scheme you need to specify the path to the library
#		and it's name
#		library: my_lib.a entry: my_lib.a or path/my_lib.a
LIBS=$(STDCPPLIBS) game media be localestub tracker translation

#	specify additional paths to directories following the standard
#	libXXX.so or libXXX.a naming scheme.  You can specify full paths
#	or paths relative to the makefile.  The paths included may not
#	be recursive, so include all of the paths where libraries can
#	be found.  Directories where source files are found are
#	automatically included.
LIBPATHS= 

#	additional paths to look for system headers
#	thes use the form: #include <header>
#	source file directories are NOT auto-included here

#	NONE, SOME, FULL
OPTIMIZE= FULL

# 	specify here the codes for languages you are going
# 	to support in this application. The default "en"
# 	one must be provided too. "make catkeys" will recreate only
# 	locales/en.catkeys file. Use it as template for creating other
# 	languages catkeys. All localization files must be placed
# 	in "locales" sub-directory.
LOCALES= ca cs de en en en_AU en_GB \

#	specify any preprocessor symbols to be defined.  The symbols will not
#	have their values set automatically; you must supply the value (if any)
#	to use.  For example, setting DEFINES to "DEBUG=1" will cause the
#	compiler option "-DDEBUG=1" to be used.  Setting DEFINES to "DEBUG"
#	would pass "-DDEBUG" on the compiler's command line.
DEFINES= 

#	specify special warning levels
#	if unspecified default warnings will be used
#	NONE = supress all warnings
#	ALL = enable all warnings
WARNINGS = ALL

#	so that stack crawls in the debugger are meaningful
#	if TRUE symbols will be created
SYMBOLS = 

#	specify debug settings

#	debugger.  Note that this will disable all optimzation.

#	This may also be specified in a resource.
APP_VERSION = 

#	(for TYPE == DRIVER only) Specify desired location of driver in the /dev
#	hierarchy. Used by the driverinstall rule. E.g., DRIVER_PATH = video/usb will
#	instruct the driverinstall rule to place a symlink to your driver's binary in
#	~/add-ons/kernel/drivers/dev/video/usb, so that your driver will appear at
#	/dev/video/usb when loaded. Default is "misc".
